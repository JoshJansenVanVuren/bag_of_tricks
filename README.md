# bag_of_tricks
Python class with various algorithms and problem solutions. Basically a corpus of CS tricks.

## Setting up
This class should be relatively self-containted, in that it should optimally not have too many dependencies. After all, these tricks have been implemented before, this is simply for learning experience.

The user should atleast have:
```
python 		 : 3.6.9
jupyter core     : 4.6.3
jupyter-notebook : 6.0.3
```

## Usage
Refer to the jupyter notebook for explanations (or at least usages) of the desired trick. Simple instantiation of BagOfTricks with a method call should also be sufficient. Otherwise refer to the source code.
